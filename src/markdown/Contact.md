You can find a list of active members of the Pantheon in-game by using the `wizlist` command.  This will also give you their email address if they chose to provide it.

You can also always send an in-game note to `Immortal` and it will reach all of the immortal staff.

Another way to reach the Pantheon and other travelers is via [Discord](https://discord.gg/5zvnAUS).
